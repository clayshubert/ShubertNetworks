Hello, my name is Clay Shubert. I am a graduate student at the University of Tennessee, Knoxville, Tickle College of Engineering pursuing a Masters of Science in Computer Engineering with a focus on Cybersecurity and Datacenter Management and Technology. I have maintained a cumulative GPA of 3.67 out of 4.00. My expected graduation date is May 2024.

In terms of professional experience, I worked at Publix Supermarkets Inc in Franklin, Tennessee for four years, where I honed my customer service and teamwork skills as a Cashier. During my time there, I cross-trained in various roles, including cashiering, self-checkout machine monitoring, and cash management. I was also trusted to function with minimal supervision on multiple tasks, including opening and closing the store.

Currently, I am a Cybersecurity Analyst Intern at Avertium Cybersecurity in Knoxville, Tennessee. In this role, I investigate alarms for various customers and various Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) systems. I escalate malicious activity to customers by phone or ticket write-up and perform immediate mitigation if necessary. I have utilized online toolkits and sandboxes to aid in my investigation of activity in customer network environments.

Outside of my professional experience, I am a member of HackUTK at the University of Tennessee, where I learn and communicate on topics related to cybersecurity. With this group of students, I competed at the Cyberforce Competition at Oak Ridge National Lab. Additionally, I have served as an Issues Committee Member for the Campus Events Board, where I planned speaking events and public forums for students at UTK.

Some of my notable skills and certifications include LRSA (LogRhythm Security Analyst) certification, proficiency in programming languages such as Python, C/C++, VHDL, and Java, and experience with SIEMs including Microsoft Sentinel One, Alienvault USM Central/Appliance, Fortinet, and LogRhythm.

I am passionate about applying my skills and knowledge in the field of cybersecurity to make a positive impact.
